# sticky-notes-frontend-3.0
Organizational Web Application (React App)

This project is a client side React application utlizing Redux for state managment. On this site users can sign up for a personal account where they can create board to store important notes about that board's topic. The client side application makes requests to a server endpoint with a noSQL database where all the information is stored. (github link for that is <a href="https://github.com/sashamars33/sticky-notes-backend-3.0">here.</a>)

Link to project: [vist here](https://stickynotes-organization.netlify.app/)

Tech used: React, Redux, TailwindCSS, React Router, Axios, HTML/CSS, JavaScript

Optimizations:
In the future I would like to add addtional options ot schemas so that users can change colors of the site as personalization.
Add a forgot password option to help with recovery for authentication. 
Add a Rich text editor for notes.

Things Learned: In this project I learned a great deal about Redux and the interactions between react application for sending and retriving data. 

Working on adding a video here so people do not need to make an account to see functionality!
